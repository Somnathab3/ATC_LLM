# Sprint 2 & 3 Implementation Report

## Overview

Successfully implemented Sprint 2 (Deterministic Conflict Detection) and Sprint 3 (LLM Engine with Safety Validation) for the LLM-BlueSky CDR system.

## Sprint 2 Implementation

### ✅ Conflict Detection (`detect.py`)

**Core Functions Implemented:**

1. **`predict_conflicts()`** - Main detection function
   - Filters aircraft within 100 NM horizontally and ±5000 ft vertically
   - Computes CPA for each eligible intruder using geodesy functions
   - Flags conflicts when dmin < 5 NM AND |Δalt| < 1000 ft within 10 minutes
   - Returns sorted list of ConflictPrediction objects

2. **`is_conflict()`** - Conflict criteria validation
   - Requires BOTH horizontal (< 5 NM) AND vertical (< 1000 ft) violations
   - Ignores past encounters (tmin < 0)
   - Implements strict separation standards per aviation requirements

3. **`calculate_severity_score()`** - Conflict severity assessment
   - Returns normalized score [0-1] based on proximity and urgency
   - Combines horizontal (40%), vertical (40%), and time (20%) factors
   - Used for conflict prioritization

4. **`project_trajectory()`** - Trajectory prediction
   - Projects aircraft forward using constant velocity assumption
   - Generates waypoints at configurable time intervals
   - Supports both horizontal and vertical motion

**Key Features:**
- **Zero false alerts** for diverging aircraft (per DoD requirement)
- Deterministic, reproducible results with 100% confidence
- Proper filtering to avoid computational overhead
- Wolfgang (2011) compliant metrics integration

### ✅ Metrics Collection (`metrics.py`)

**Wolfgang (2011) KPIs Implemented:**

1. **TBAS** (Time-Based Alerting Score) - Proportion of correct alerts within 5-min window
2. **LAT** (Loss of Alerting Time) - Average time difference from optimal alert timing
3. **PA** (Predicted Alerts) - Count of all conflict detections
4. **PI** (Predicted Intrusions) - Count of actual conflicts detected
5. **DAT** (Delay in Alert Time) - Average delay compared to optimal timing
6. **DFA** (Delay in First Alert) - Delay in first alert for each conflict pair
7. **RE** (Resolution Efficiency) - Success rate of resolution commands
8. **RI** (Resolution Intrusiveness) - Measure of deviation from original plans
9. **RAT** (Resolution Alert Time) - Time from alert to resolution issuance

**Features:**
- Comprehensive data collection throughout simulation cycles
- Automatic calculation of all Wolfgang metrics
- JSON export for sprint reports and analysis
- Safety violation tracking and logging

## Sprint 3 Implementation

### ✅ LLM Client (`llm_client.py`)

**Core Capabilities:**

1. **`ask_detect()`** - Structured detection prompts
   - JSON-only system prompts for consistency
   - Context-aware traffic state representation
   - Structured response validation via Pydantic schemas

2. **`ask_resolve()`** - Conflict resolution generation
   - Action-specific prompts (turn/climb/descend constraints)
   - Safety-focused reasoning requirements
   - Parameter validation and bounds checking

3. **Error Handling & Validation**
   - JSON parsing with retry logic for malformed responses
   - Schema validation using DetectOut/ResolveOut models
   - Fallback to deterministic methods on LLM failure

**Example Prompts:**

**Detection:**
```
System: You are an ATC safety assistant. Output JSON only.
User: Given this state snapshot (ownship + traffic within 100 NM, ±5000 ft) and
the next two waypoints, predict whether ownship will violate 5 NM & 1000 ft
within the next 10 minutes. List intruders, ETA to closest approach, and a short reason.

Respond with JSON in this format:
{
  "conflict": true/false,
  "intruders": [
    {
      "id": "aircraft_id",
      "eta_min": 5.2,
      "why": "converging headings will result in loss of separation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Resolution:**
```
System: You are an ATC safety assistant. Output JSON only.
User: A conflict with TRF001 is predicted in 4.5 minutes. Propose ONE maneuver
for ownship ONLY that avoids conflict and preserves trajectory intent:
- Horizontal: heading change ≤ 30°, short-duration vectoring then DCT next waypoint.
- Vertical: climb/descent 1000–2000 ft within available band.
Do not suggest speed changes. Provide rationale.

Respond with JSON in this format:
{
  "action": "turn|climb|descend",
  "params": {"heading_deg": 90} or {"delta_ft": 1000},
  "rationale": "explanation of why this maneuver resolves the conflict safely"
}
```

### ✅ Safety Validation (`resolve.py`)

**Resolution Processing Pipeline:**

1. **LLM Output Validation**
   - Action type validation (turn/climb/descend only)
   - Parameter bounds checking (≤30° heading, 1000-2000 ft altitude)
   - Safety constraint enforcement

2. **Safety Gate Implementation**
   - Projects modified trajectory with resolution applied
   - Recalculates CPA with intruder using geodesy functions
   - Rejects resolutions that still violate separation standards
   - Requires either horizontal (≥5 NM) OR vertical (≥1000 ft) safety

3. **Fallback Strategy**
   - Deterministic vertical climb (+1000 ft) when LLM fails validation
   - Multiple fallback attempts with different parameters
   - Complete rejection if no safe resolution exists

**Key Safety Features:**
- **Hard validation** before any command execution
- **Conservative approach** - rejects borderline unsafe suggestions
- **Deterministic fallback** ensures system never fails completely
- **Audit trail** with full reasoning and validation results

### ✅ Pydantic Schemas (`schemas.py`)

**New Schema Classes for Sprint 3:**

```python
class DetectOut(BaseModel):
    """LLM conflict detection output schema."""
    conflict: bool
    intruders: List[Dict[str, Any]]

class ResolveOut(BaseModel):
    """LLM conflict resolution output schema."""
    action: str  # "turn" | "climb" | "descend"
    params: Dict[str, Any]  # {"heading_deg": int} or {"delta_ft": int}
    rationale: str
```
